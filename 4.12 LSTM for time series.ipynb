      "mr. and mrs. dursley, of number four, privet drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. they were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense. \n",
      "\n",
      "mr. dursley was the director of a firm called grunnings, which made drills. he was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. mrs. dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. the dursleys had a small son called dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. \n",
      "\n",
      "the dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. they didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the potters. mrs. potter was mrs. dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years; in fact, mrs. dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as undursleyish as it was possible to be. the dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the potters arrived in the street. the dursleys knew that the potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. this boy was another good reason for keeping the potters away; they didn't want dudley mixing with a child like that. \n",
      "\n",
      "when mr. and mrs. dursley woke up on the dull, gray tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. mr. dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and mrs. dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming dudley into his high chair. \n",
      "\n",
      "none of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window. \n",
      "\n",
      "at half past eight, mr. dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked mrs. dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss dudley good-bye but missed, because dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. \"little tyke,\" chortled mr. dursley as he left the house. he got into his car and backed out of number four's drive. \n",
      "\n",
      "it was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar -- a cat reading a map. for a second, mr. dursley didn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to look again. there was a tabby cat standing on the corner of privet drive, but there wasn't a map in sight. what could he have been thinking of? it must have been a trick of the light. mr. dursley blinked and stared at the cat. it stared back. as mr. dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. it was now reading the sign that said privet drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats couldn't read maps or signs. mr. dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. as he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day. \n",
      "\n",
      "but on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. as he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. people in cloaks. mr. dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! he supposed this was some stupid new fashion. he drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. they were whispering excitedly together. mr. dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! the nerve of him! but then it struck mr. dursley that this was probably some silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something... \n",
      "\n",
      "yes, that would be it. the traffic moved on and a few minutes later, mr. dursley arrived in the grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills. \n",
      "\n",
      "mr. dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. if he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. he didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. mr. dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. he yelled at five different people. he made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. he was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery. \n",
      "\n",
      "he'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's. he eyed them angrily as he passed. he didn't know why, but they made him uneasy. this bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin. it was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"the potters, that's right, that's what i heard yes, their son, harry\" \n",
      "\n",
      "mr. dursley stopped dead. fear flooded him. he looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it. \n",
      "\n",
      "he dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. he put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was being stupid. potter wasn't such an unusual name. he was sure there were lots of people called potter who had a son called harry. come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called harry. he'd never even seen the boy. it might have been harvey. or harold. there was no point in worrying mrs. dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. he didn't blame her -- if he'd had a sister like that... but all the same, those people in cloaks... \n",
      "\n",
      "he found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"sorry,\" he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. it was a few seconds before mr. dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. he didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. on the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \"don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! rejoice, for you-know-who has gone at last! even muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!\" \n",
      "\n",
      "and the old man hugged mr. dursley around the middle and walked off. \n",
      "\n",
      "mr. dursley stood rooted to the spot. he had been hugged by a complete stranger. he also thought he had been called a muggle, whatever that was. he was rattled. he hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn't approve of imagination. \n",
      "\n",
      "as he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw -- and it didn't improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning. it was now sitting on his garden wall. he was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"shoo!\" said mr. dursley loudly. the cat didn't move. it just gave him a stern look. was this normal cat behavior? mr. dursley wondered. trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. he was still determined not to mention anything to his wife. \n",
      "\n",
      "mrs. dursley had had a nice, normal day. she told him over dinner all about mrs. next door's problems with her daughter and how dudley had learned a new word (\"won't!\"). mr. dursley tried to act normally. when dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news: \"and finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today. although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.\" the newscaster allowed himself a grin. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"most mysterious. and now, over to jim mcguffin with the weather. going to be any more showers of owls tonight, jim?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"well, ted,\" said the weatherman, \"i don't know about that, but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. viewers as far apart as kent, yorkshire, and dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain i promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting stars! perhaps people have been celebrating bonfire night early -- it's not until next week, folks! but i can promise a wet night tonight.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "mr. dursley sat frozen in his armchair. shooting stars all over britain? owls flying by daylight? mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? and a whisper, a whisper about the potters... \n",
      "\n",
      "mrs. dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. it was no good. he'd have to say something to her. he cleared his throat nervously. \"er -- petunia, dear -- you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "as he had expected, mrs. dursley looked shocked and angry. after all, they normally pretended she didn't have a sister. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"no,\" she said sharply. \"why?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"funny stuff on the news,\" mr. dursley mumbled. \"owls... shooting stars... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today...\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"so?\" snapped mrs. dursley. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"well, i just thought... maybe... it was something to do with... you know... her crowd.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "mrs. dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. mr. dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name \"potter.\" he decided he didn't dare. instead he said, as casually as he could, \"their son -- he'd be about dudley's age now, wouldn't he?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"i suppose so,\" said mrs. dursley stiffly. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"what's his name again? howard, isn't it?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"harry. nasty, common name, if you ask me.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"oh, yes,\" said mr. dursley, his heart sinking horribly. \"yes, i quite agree.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "he didn't say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. \n",
      "\n",
      "while mrs. dursley was in the bathroom, mr. dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. the cat was still there. \n",
      "\n",
      "it was staring down privet drive as though it were waiting for something. \n",
      "\n",
      "was he imagining things? could all this have anything to do with the potters? if it did... if it got out that they were related to a pair of -- well, he didn't think he could bear it. \n",
      "\n",
      "the dursleys got into bed. mrs. dursley fell asleep quickly but mr. dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. his last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and mrs. dursley. the potters knew very well what he and petunia thought about them and their kind.... he couldn't see how he and petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on -- he yawned and turned over -- it couldn't affect them.... \n",
      "\n",
      "how very wrong he was. \n",
      "\n",
      "mr. dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. it was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of privet drive. it didn't so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. in fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all. \n",
      "\n",

      "nothing like this man had ever been seen on privet drive. he was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. he was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. \n",
      "\n",

      "albus dumbledore didn't seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. he was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for something. but he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. for some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. he chuckled and muttered, \"i should have known.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "he found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. it seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. he flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. the nearest street lamp went out with a little pop. he clicked it again -- the next lamp flickered into darkness. twelve times he clicked the put-outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. if anyone looked out of their window now, even beady-eyed mrs. dursley, they wouldn't be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. dumbledore slipped the put-outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. he didn't look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it. \n",

      "\"i know you haven 't, said professor mcgonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. \"but you're different. everyone knows you're the only one you-know- oh, all right, voldemort, was frightened of.\" \n",

      "it seemed that professor mcgonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. it was plain that whatever \"everyone\" was saying, she was not going to believe it until dumbledore told her it was true. dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer. \n",

      "\n",
      "\"exactly,\" said dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. \"it would be enough to turn any boy's head. famous before he can walk and talk! famous for something he won't even remember! cara you see how much better off he'll be, growing up away from all that until he's ready to take it?\" \n",

      "\n",
      "if the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. he was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. he looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild - long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. in his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets. \n",

      "\"yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, hagrid, or we'll be found,\" professor mcgonagall whispered, patting hagrid gingerly on the arm as dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. he laid harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside harry's blankets, and then came back to the other two. for a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; hagrid's shoulders shook, professor mcgonagall blinked furiously, and the twinkling light that usually shone from dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out. \n",

      "\"well,\" said dumbledore finally, \"that's that. we've no business staying here. we may as well go and join the celebrations.\" \n",

      "just then, the doorbell rang -- \"oh, good lord, they're here!\" said aunt petunia frantically -- and a moment later, dudley's best friend, piers polkiss, walked in with his mother. piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. he was usually the one who held people's arms behind their backs while dudley hit them. dudley stopped pretending to cry at once. \n",
      "\n",
      "half an hour later, harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the dursleys' car with piers and dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. his aunt and uncle hadn't been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they'd left, uncle vernon had taken harry aside. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"i'm warning you,\" he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to harry's, \"i'm warning you now, boy -- any funny business, anything at all -- and you'll be in that cupboard from now until christmas.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"i'm not going to do anything,\" said harry, \"honestly.. \n",
      "\n",
      "but uncle vernon didn't believe him. no one ever did. \n",
      "\n",
      "the problem was, strange things often happened around harry and it was just no good telling the dursleys he didn't make them happen. \n",
      "\n",
      "once, aunt petunia, tired of harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn't been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except for his bangs, which she left \"to hide that horrible scar.\" dudley had laughed himself silly at harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glasses. \n",
      "\n",
      "next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before aunt petunia had sheared it off he had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly. \n",
      "\n",
      "another time, aunt petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of dudley's (brown with orange puff balls) -- the harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit harry. aunt petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, harry wasn't punished. \n",
      "\n",
      "on the other hand, he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. dudley's gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to harry's surprise as anyone else's, there he was sitting on the chimney. the dursleys had received a very angry letter from harry's headmistress telling them harry had been climbing school buildings. but all he'd tried to do (as he shouted at uncle vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid- jump. \n",
      "\n",
      "but today, nothing was going to go wrong. it was even worth being with dudley and piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn't school, his cupboard, or mrs. figg's cabbage-smelling living room. \n",
      "\n",
      "while he drove, uncle vernon complained to aunt petunia. he liked to complain about things: people at work, harry, the council, harry, the bank, and harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. this morning, it was motorcycles. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"... roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,\" he said, as a motorcycle overtook them. \n",
      "\n",
      "i had a dream about a motorcycle,\" said harry, remembering suddenly. \"it was flying.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "uncle vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. he turned right around in his seat and yelled at harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: \"motorcycles don't fly!\" \n",
      "\n",
      "dudley and piers sniggered. \n",
      "\n",
      "i know they don't,\" said harry. \"it was only a dream.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "but he wished he hadn't said anything. if there was one thing the dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn't, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon -- they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas. \n",
      "\n",
      "it was a very sunny saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. the dursleys bought dudley and piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. it wasn't bad, either, harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like dudley, except that it wasn't blond. \n",
      "\n",
      "harry had the best morning he'd had in a long time. he was careful to walk a little way apart from the dursleys so that dudley and piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn't fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. they ate in the zoo restaurant, and when dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn't have enough ice cream on top, uncle vernon bought him another one and harry was allowed to finish the first. \n",
      "\n",
      "harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last. \n",
      "\n",
      "after lunch they went to the reptile house. it was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. dudley and piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. it could have wrapped its body twice around uncle vernon's car and crushed it into a trash can -- but at the moment it didn't look in the mood. in fact, it was fast asleep. \n",
      "\n",
      "dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"make it move,\" he whined at his father. uncle vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn't budge. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"do it again,\" dudley ordered. uncle vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"this is boring,\" dudley moaned. he shuffled away. \n",
      "\n",
      "harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. he wouldn't have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself -- no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. it was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was aunt petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house. \n",
      "\n",
      "the snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with harry's. \n",
      "\n",
      "it winked. \n",
      "\n",
      "harry stared. then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. they weren't. he looked back at the snake and winked, too. \n",
      "\n",
      "the snake jerked its head toward uncle vernon and dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. it gave harry a look that said quite plainly: \"i get that all the time. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"i know,\" harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn't sure the snake could hear him. \"it must be really annoying.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "the snake nodded vigorously. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"where do you come from, anyway?\" harry asked. \n",
      "\n",
      "the snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. harry peered at it. \n",
      "\n",
      "boa constrictor, brazil. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"was it nice there?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "the boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and harry read on: this specimen was bred in the zoo. \"oh, i see -- so you've never been to brazil?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "as the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind harry made both of them jump. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"dudley! mr. dursley! come and look at this snake! you won't believe what it's doing!\" \n",
      "\n",
      "dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"out of the way, you,\" he said, punching harry in the ribs. caught by surprise, harry fell hard on the concrete floor. what came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened -- one second, piers and dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror. \n",
      "\n",
      "harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor's tank had vanished. the great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. people throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits. \n",
      "\n",
      "as the snake slid swiftly past him, harry could have sworn a low, hissing voice said, \"brazil, here i come.... thanksss, amigo.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "the keeper of the reptile house was in shock. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"but the glass,\" he kept saying, \"where did the glass go?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "the zoo director himself made aunt petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. piers and dudley could only gibber. as far as harry had seen, the snake hadn't done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in uncle vernon's car, dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. but worst of all, for harry at least, was piers calming down enough to say, \"harry was talking to it, weren't you, harry?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "uncle vernon waited until piers was safely out of the house before starting on harry. he was so angry he could hardly speak. he managed to say, \"go -- cupboard -- stay -- no meals,\" before he collapsed into a chair, and aunt petunia had to run and get him a large brandy. \n",
      "\n",
      "harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. he didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure the dursleys were asleep yet. until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food. \n",
      "\n",
      "he'd lived with the dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, as long as he could remember, ever since he'd been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. he couldn't remember being in the car when his parents had died. sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burn- ing pain on his forehead. this, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn't imagine where all the green light came from. he couldn't remember his parents at all. his aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. there were no photographs of them in the house. \n",
      "\n",
      "when he had been younger, harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the dursleys were his only family. yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. very strange strangers they were, too. a tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with aunt petunia and dudley. after asking harry furiously if he knew the man, aunt petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. a wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. a bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. the weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second harry tried to get a closer look. \n",
      "\n",
      "at school, harry had no one. everybody knew that dudley's gang hated that odd harry potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with dudley's gang. \n",

      "\n",
      "the letters from no one \n",
      "\n",
      "the escape of the brazilian boa constrictor earned harry his longest-ever punishment. by the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old mrs. figg as she crossed privet drive on her crutches. \n",
      "\n",
      "harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping dudley's gang, who visited the house every single day. piers, dennis, malcolm, and gordon were all big and stupid, but as dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. the rest of them were all quite happy to join in dudley's favorite sport: harry hunting. \n",
      "\n",
      "this was why harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. when september came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn't be with dudley. dudley had been accepted at uncle vernon's old private school, smeltings. piers polkiss was going there too. harry, on the other hand, was going to stonewall high, the local public school. dudley thought this was very funny. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"they stuff people's heads down the toilet the first day at stonewall,\" \n",
      "\n",
      "he told harry. \"want to come upstairs and practice?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"no, thanks,\" said harry. \"the poor toilet's never had anything as horrible as your head down it -- it might be sick.\" then he ran, before dudley could work out what he'd said. \n",
      "\n",
      "one day in july, aunt petunia took dudley to london to buy his smeltings uniform, leaving harry at mrs. figg's. mrs. figg wasn 't as bad as usual. it turned out she'd broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn't seem quite as fond of them as before. she let harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she'd had it for several years. \n",
      "\n",
      "that evening, dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform. smeltings' boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. they also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren't looking. this was supposed to be good training for later life. \n",
      "\n",
      "as he looked at dudley in his new knickerbockers, uncle vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. aunt petunia burst into tears and said she couldn't believe it was her ickle dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. harry didn't trust himself to speak. he thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh. \n",
      "\n",
      "there was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when harry went in for breakfast. it seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. he went to have a look. the tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"what's this?\" he asked aunt petunia. her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"your new school uniform,\" she said. \n",
      "\n",
      "harry looked in the bowl again. \n",

      "\"oh,\" he said, \"i didn't realize it had to be so wet.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"dota be stupid,\" snapped aunt petunia. \"i'm dyeing some of dudley's old things gray for you. it'll look just like everyone else's when i've finished.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. he sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at stonewall high -- like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably. \n",
      "\n",
      "dudley and uncle vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from harry's new uniform. uncle vernon opened his newspaper as usual and dudley banged his smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table. \n",
      "\n",
      "they heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat. \n",
      "\n",

      "harry dodged the smelting stick and went to get the mail. three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from uncle vernon's sister marge, who was vacationing on the isle of wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and -- a letter for harry. \n",
      "\n",
      "harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. no one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. who would? he had no friends, no other relatives -- he didn't belong to the library, so he'd never even got rude notes asking for books back. yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake: mr. h. potter the cupboard under the stairs 4 privet drive little whinging surrey the envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. there was no stamp. \n",
      "\n",
      "turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter h. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"hurry up, boy!\" shouted uncle vernon from the kitchen. \"what are you doing, checking for letter bombs?\" he chuckled at his own joke. \n",
      "\n",
      "harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. he handed uncle vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope. \n",
      "\n",
      "uncle vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"marge's ill,\" he informed aunt petunia. \"ate a funny whelk. --.\" \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"who'd be writing to you?\" sneered uncle vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. his face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. and it didn't stop there. within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"p-p-petunia!\" he gasped. \n",
      "\n",
      "dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but uncle vernon held it high out of his reach. aunt petunia took it curiously and read the first line. for a moment it looked as though she might faint. she clutched her throat and made a choking noise. \n",

      "\"vernon! oh my goodness -- vernon!\" \n",
      "\n",
      "they stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that harry and dudley were still in the room. dudley wasn't used to being ignored. he gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his smelting stick. \n",

      "\n",
      "\"out!\" roared uncle vernon, and he took both harry and dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. harry and dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; dudley won, so harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor. \n",
      "\n",

      "as night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. spray from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows. aunt petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. she and uncle vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket. \n",
      "\n",
      "the storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. harry couldn't sleep. he shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. dudley's snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. the lighted dial of dudley's watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told harry he'd be eleven in ten minutes' time. he lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now. \n",

      "\n",
      "the giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. he bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame. the noise of the storm outside dropped a little. he turned to look at them all. \n",

      "\"ah, shut up, dursley, yeh great prune,\" said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of uncle vernon's hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room. \n",
      "\n",
      "uncle vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on. \n",

      "\n",
      "from an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box. harry opened it with trembling fingers. inside was a large, sticky chocolate cake with happy birthday harry written on it in green icing. \n",

      "\n",
      "the giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, dudley fidgeted a little. uncle vernon said sharply, \"don't touch anything he gives you, dudley.\" \n",

      "\n",
      "at first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages. harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. the rattling cart seemed to know its own way, because griphook wasn't steering. \n",
      "\n",
      "harry's eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late - - they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and floor. \n",
      "\n",
      "i never know,\" harry called to hagrid over the noise of the cart, \"what's the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?\" \n",

      "\n",
      "griphook unlocked the door. a lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, harry gasped. inside were mounds of gold coins. columns of silver. heaps of little bronze knuts. \n",

      "\"all yours,\" smiled hagrid. \n",
      "\n",
      "all harry's -- it was incredible. the dursleys couldn't have known about this or they'd have had it from him faster than blinking. how often had they complained how much harry cost them to keep? and all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him, buried deep under london. \n",

      "\"one speed only,\" said griphook. \n",

      "\n",
      "vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole. \n",

      "\"if anyone but a gringotts goblin tried that, they'd be sucked through the door and trapped in there,\" said griphook. \n",

      "\n",
      "something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least -- but at first he thought it was empty. then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask. \n",

      "\n",
      "\"well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but i know i'll be in slytherin, all our family have been -- imagine being in hufflepuff, i think i'd leave, wouldn't you?\" \"mmm,\" said harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"i say, look at that man!\" said the boy suddenly, nodding toward the front window. hagrid was standing there, grinning at harry and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn't come in. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"that's hagrid,\" said harry, pleased to know something the boy didn't. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"he works at hogwarts.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"oh,\" said the boy, \"i've heard of him. he's a sort of servant, isn't he?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"he's the gamekeeper,\" said harry. he was liking the boy less and less every second. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"yes, exactly. i heard he's a sort of savage -- lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed.\" \n",

      "\n",
      "\"i really don't think they should let the other sort in, do you? they're just not the same, they've never been brought up to know our ways. some of them have never even heard of hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. i think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. \n",

      "what's your surname, anyway?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "but before harry could answer, madam malkin said, \"that's you done, my dear,\" and harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool. \n",

      "\n",
      "\"nothing,\" harry lied. they stopped to buy parchment and quills. harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. when they had left the shop, he said, \"hagrid, what's quidditch?\" \n",

      "harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but mr. ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once. \n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "harry didn't think there was anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl. after all, he'd never had any money in his life until a month ago, and he told ron so, all about having to wear dudley's old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. this seemed to cheer ron up. \n",

      "he had never had any money for candy with the dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready to buy as many mars bars as he could carry -- but the woman didn't have mars bars. what she did have were bettie bott's every flavor beans, drooble's best blowing gum, chocolate frogs. pumpkin pasties, cauldron cakes, licorice wands, and a number of other strange things harry had never seen in his life. not wanting to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver sickles and seven bronze knuts. \n",

      "\n",
      "harry unwrapped his chocolate frog and picked up the card. it showed a man's face. he wore half- moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. underneath the picture was the name albus dumbledore. \n",

      "\"so this is dumbledore!\" said harry. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"don't tell me you'd never heard of dumbledore!\" said ron. \"can i have a frog? i might get agrippa -- thanks harry turned over his card and read: albus dumbledore currently headmaster of hogwarts considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, nicolas flamel. professor dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling. \n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "harry stared as dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile. ron was more interested in eating the frogs than looking at the famous witches and wizards cards, but harry couldn't keep his eyes off them. soon he had not only dumbledore and morgana, but hengist of woodcroft, alberic grunnion, circe, paracelsus, and merlin. \n",

      "\n",
      "\"you want to be careful with those,\" ron warned harry. \"when they say every flavor, they mean every flavor -- you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar- malade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. george reckons he had a boogerflavored one once.\" \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "the countryside now flying past the window was becoming wilder. the neat fields had gone. now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills. \n",

      "\n",
      "he waved his wand, but nothing happened. scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"are you sure that's a real spell?\" said the girl. \"well, it's not very good, is it? i've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it's all worked for me. nobody in my family's magic at all, it was ever such a surprise when i got my letter, but i was ever so pleased, of course, i mean, it's the very best school of witchcraft there is, i've heard -- i've learned all our course books by heart, of course, i just hope it will be enough -- i'm hermione granger, by the way, who are you. \n",
      "\n",
      "she said all this very fast. \n",

      "and she left, taking the toadless boy with her. \n",

      "\n",
      "\"gryffindor,\" said ron. gloom seemed to be settling on him again. \"mom and dad were in it, too. i don't know what they'll say if i'm not. i don't suppose ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me in slytherin.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"that's the house vol-, i mean, you-know-who was in?\" \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"you know, i think the ends of scabbers' whiskers are a bit lighter,\" \n",
      "\n",
      "said harry, trying to take ron's mind off houses. \"so what do your oldest brothers do now that they've left, anyway?\" \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"charlie's in romania studying dragons, and bill's in africa doing something for gringotts,\" said ron. \"did you hear about gringotts? it's been all over the daily prophet, but i don't suppose you get that with the muggles -- someone tried to rob a high security vault.\" \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"really? what happened to them?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"nothing, that's why it's such big news. they haven't been caught. my dad says it must've been a powerful dark wizard to get round gringotts, but they don't think they took anything, that's what's odd. 'course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case you-know-who's behind it.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "harry turned this news over in his mind. he was starting to get a prickle of fear every time you- know-who was mentioned. he supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but it had been a lot more comfortable saying \"voldemort\" without worrying. \n",

      "\"what's your quidditch team?\" ron asked. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"er -- i don't know any,\" harry confessed. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"what!\" ron looked dumbfounded. \"oh, you wait, it's the best game in the world --\" and he was off, explaining all about the four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous games he'd been to with his brothers and the broomstick he'd like to get if he had the money. he was just taking harry through the finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn't neville the toadless boy, or hermione granger this time. \n",
      "\n",
      "three boys entered, and harry recognized the middle one at once: it was the pale boy from madam malkin's robe shop. he was looking at harry with a lot more interest than he'd shown back in diagon alley. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"yes,\" said harry. he was looking at the other boys. both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean. standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards. \n",

      "draco malfoy didn't go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"i'd be careful if i were you, potter,\" he said slowly. \"unless you're a bit politer you'll go the same way as your parents. they didn't know what was good for them, either. you hang around with riffraff like the weasleys and that hagrid, and it'll rub off on you.\" \n",

      "\"heads down!\" yelled hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. they were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles. \n",

      "\"run!\" harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the gallery, not looking back to see whether filch was following -- they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, harry in the lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going -- they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their charms classroom, which they knew was miles from the trophy room. \n",

      "harry groped for the doorknob -- between filch and death, he'd take filch. \n",
      "\n",
      "they fell backward -- harry slammed the door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn't see him anywhere, but they hardly cared -- all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster. they didn't stop running until they reached the portrait of the fat lady on the seventh floor. \n",

      "\n",
      "\"no, not the floor. it was standing on a trapdoor. it's obviously guarding something.\" \n",

      "\"or both,\" said harry. \n",

      "as the owls flooded into the great hall as usual, everyone's attention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his bacon to the floor. they had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel. \n",

      "as seven o'clock drew nearer, harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the quidditch field. held never been inside the stadium before. hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on. at either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end. they reminded harry of the little plastic sticks muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high. \n",
      "\n",
      "too eager to fly again to wait for wood, harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground. what a feeling -- he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field. the nimbus two thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch. \n",

      "\n",
      "he opened the crate. inside were four different-sized balls. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"right,\" said wood. \"now, quidditch is easy enough to understand, even if it's not too easy to play. there are seven players on each side. \n",
      "\n",
      "three of them are called chasers.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"three chasers,\" harry repeated, as wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"this ball's called the quaffle,\" said wood. \"the chasers throw the quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal. ten points every time the quaffle goes through one of the hoops. follow me?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"the chasers throw the quaffle and put it through the hoops to score,\" \n",

      "\n",
      "\"three chasers, one keeper,\" said harry, who was determined to remember it all. \"and they play with the quaffle. okay, got that. so what are they for?\" he pointed at the three balls left inside the box. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"i'll show you now,\" said wood. \"take this.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "he handed harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"i'm going to show you what the bludgers do,\" wood said. \"these two are the bludgers.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "he showed harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than the red quaffle. harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"stand back,\" wood warned harry. he bent down and freed one of the bludgers. \n",
      "\n",
      "at once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at harry's face. harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air -- it zoomed around their heads and then shot at wood, who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"see?\" wood panted, forcing the struggling bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely. \"the bludgers rocket around, trying to knock players off their brooms. that's why you have two beaters on each team -- the weasley twins are ours -- it's their job to protect their side from the bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. so -- think you've got all that?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"three chasers try and score with the quaffle; the keeper guards the goal posts; the beaters keep the bludgers away from their team,\" harry reeled off. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"very good,\" said wood. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"er -- have the bludgers ever killed anyone?\" harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"never at hogwarts. we've had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that. now, the last member of the team is the seeker. that's you. and you don't have to worry about the quaffle or the bludgers unless they crack my head open.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"don't worry, the weasleys are more than a match for the bludgers -- i mean, they're like a pair of human bludgers themselves.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball. \n",
      "\n",
      "compared with the quaffle and the bludgers, it was tiny, about the size of a large walnut. it was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"this,\" said wood, \"is the golden snitch, and it's the most important ball of the lot. it's very hard to catch because it's so fast and difficult to see. it's the seeker's job to catch it. you've got to weave in and out of the chasers, beaters, bludgers, and quaffle to get it before the other team's seeker, because whichever seeker catches the snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. that's why seekers get fouled so much. a game of quidditch only ends when the snitch is caught, so it can go on for ages -- i think the record is three months, they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep. \"well, that's it -- any questions?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "harry shook his head. he understood what he had to do all right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"we won't practice with the snitch yet,\" said wood, carefully shutting it back inside the crate, \"it's too dark, we might lose it. let's try you out with a few of these.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "he pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later, he and harry were up in the air, wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for harry to catch. \n",

      "harry didn't miss a single one, and wood was delighted. after half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn't carry on. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"that quidditch cup'll have our name on it this year,\" said wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. \"i wouldn't be surprised if you turn out better than charlie weasley, and he could have played for england if he hadn't gone off chasing dragons.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he'd already been at hogwarts two months. the castle felt more like home than privet drive ever had. his lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics. \n",

      "\n",
      "it was a horrible sight. twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. it had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat, horny feet. the smell coming from it was incredible. it was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long. \n",

      "\"oy, pea-brain!\" yelled ron from the other side of the chamber, and he threw a metal pipe at it. the troll didn't even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward ron instead, giving harry time to run around it. \n",

      "\n",
      "harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything, but he wasn't very hopeful. they had been looking for two weeks, after a, but as they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn't surprising they'd found nothing. what they really needed was a nice long search without madam pince breathing down their necks. \n",

      "\n",
      "the restricted section was right at the back of the library. step ping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles. \n",

      "\n",
      "one book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood. the hairs on the back of harry's neck prickled. maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be. \n",
      "\n",
      "he had to start somewhere. setting the lamp down carefully on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book. a large black and silver volume caught his eye. he pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it on his knee, let it fall open. \n",
      "\n",
      "a piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence -- the book was screaming! harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. he stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once. panicking, he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside -- stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. he passed filch in the doorway; filch's pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and harry slipped under filch's outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor, the book's shrieks still ringing in his ears. \n",
      "\n",
      "he came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. he had been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn't paid attention to where he was going. perhaps because it was dark, he didn't recognize where he was at all. there was a suit of armor near the kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there. \n",

      "\n",
      "harry stood rooted to the spot as filch and snape came around the corner ahead. they couldn't see him, of course, but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they'd knock right into him -- the cloak didn't stop him from being solid. \n",
      "\n",
      "he backed away as quietly as he could. a door stood ajar to his left. it was his only hope. he squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything. they walked straight past, and harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply, listening to their footsteps dying away. that had been close, very close. it was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in. \n",
      "\n",
      "it looked like an unused classroom. the dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket -- but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn't look as if it belonged there, something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way. \n",
      "\n",
      "it was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. there was an inscription carved around the top: erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi. his panic fading now that there was no sound of filch and snape, harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again. he stepped in front of it. \n",
      "\n",
      "he had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming. he whirled around. his heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed -- for he had seen not only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him. \n",
      "\n",
      "but the room was empty. breathing very fast, he turned slowly back to the mirror. \n",
      "\n",
      "there he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. harry looked over his shoulder -- but still, no one was there. or were they all invisible, too? was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror's trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not? he looked in the mirror again. a woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving. he reached out a hand and felt the air behind him. if she was really there, he'd touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air -- she and the others existed only in the mirror. \n",
      "\n",
      "she was a very pretty woman. she had dark red hair and her eyes -- her eyes are just like mine, harry thought, edging a little closer to the glass. bright green -- exactly the same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same time. the tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his arm around her. he wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. it stuck up at the back, just as harry's did. \n",

      "\n",
      "they just looked at him, smiling. and slowly, harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who looked as though he had harry's knobbly knees -- harry was looking at his family, for the first time in his life. \n",
      "\n",
      "the potters smiled and waved at harry and he stared hungrily back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. he had a powerful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness. \n",
      "\n",
      "how long he stood there, he didn't know. the reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses. he couldn't stay here, he had to find his way back to bed. he tore his eyes away from his mother's face, whispered, \"i'll come back,\" \n",

      "\n",
      "harry couldn't eat. he had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight. he had almost forgotten about flamel. it didn't seem very important anymore. who cared what the three headed dog was guarding? what did it matter if snape stole it, really? \"are you all right?\" said ron. \"you look odd.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "what harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again. with ron covered in the cloak, too, they had to walk much more slowly the next night. they tried retracing harry's route from the library, wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour. \n",

      "\n",
      "there have been many reports of the sorcerer's stone over the centuries, but the only stone currently in existence belongs to mr. nicolas flamel, the noted alchemist and opera lover. mr. flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in devon with his wife, perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight). \n",

      "\n",
      "\"i'm going to play,\" he told ron and hermione. \"if i don't, all the slytherins will think i'm just too scared to face snape. i'll show them... it'll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.\" \n",

      "\n",
      "harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon, that ron and hermione were wondering whether they'd ever see him alive again. this wasn't what you'd call comforting. harry hardly heard a word of wood's pep talk as he pulled on his quidditch robes and picked up his nimbus two thousand. \n",

      "harry knew ron and hermione were thinking the same as he was. if snape had been in on protecting the stone, it must have been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it. he probably knew everything -- except, it seemed, quirrell's spell and how to get past fluffy. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"you're the only one who knows how to get past fluffy. aren't you, hagrid?\" said harry anxiously. \"and you wouldn't tell anyone, would you? not even one of the teachers?\" \n",

      "\n",
      "\"where did you get it, hagrid?\" said ron, crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg. \"it must've cost you a fortune.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"won it,\" said hagrid. \"las' night. i was down in the village havin' a few drinks an' got into a game o' cards with a stranger. think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.\" \n",

      "\n",
      "\"well, i've bin doin' some readin' , said hagrid, pulling a large book from under his pillow. \"got this outta the library -- dragon breeding for pleasure and profit -- it's a bit outta date, o' course, but it's all in here. keep the egg in the fire, 'cause their mothers breathe on i em, see, an' when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o' brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour. an' see here -- how ter recognize diff'rent eggs -- what i got there's a norwegian ridgeback. they're rare, them.\" \n",

      "\n",
      "\"wonder what it's like to have a peaceful life,\" ron sighed, as evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting. hermione had now started making study schedules for harry and ron, too. it was driving them nuts. \n",

      "ron and hermione argued all the way to herbology and in the end, hermione agreed to run down to hagrid's with the other two during morning break. when the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest. hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited. \n",

      "\n",
      "all at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open. the baby dragon flopped onto the table. it wasn't exactly pretty; harry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. its spiny wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, orange eyes. \n",
      "\n",
      "it sneezed. a couple of sparks flew out of its snout. \n",
